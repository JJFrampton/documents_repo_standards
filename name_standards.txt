*repo_name_standards*

repo name should be concise but descriptive enough to understand

the identifiers should be orders in acending order of specificity
ie:
<course><area><>specific course>
courses_machine_learning_andrew_ng
courses_machine_learning_ibm

the first word /term should be one of the groups used in the repos already
so far the following are the established main groups

documents [text books, notes, how-tos]
courses [online courses, books, tutorials]
projects [personal projects]
configs [no sub repos yet]
scripts [no sub repos yet]
images [no sub repos yet]
fonts [no sub repos yet]
hg [hire ground repos]
